- finish filling the form [subject_access_request_form_prefilled_Uber.md](subject_access_request_form_prefilled_Uber.md), a prefilled version of the original [subject_access_request_form_Uber.pdf](subject_access_request_form_Uber.pdf), by replacing the templating entries. Pay attention to (*) symbols, so for the `country of residence` entry, leave empty and let Uber determine which law applies (they might make a mistake!). 
-  preferably from the address used to register for Uber, send that filled form as attachment to Pein Van Noort ( `pein.vannoort@uber.com` ) with subject "Subject access request" and text "Please find attached a Subject Access Request form"
-  preferably from the address used to register for Uber, send [letter_Uber.md](letter_Uber.md) to Pein Van Noort ( `pein.vannoort@uber.com` ) and Cc: `GetMy@PersonalData.IO` (after changing `{{requester.name}}` in the template)
