- finish filling the form [Uber-subject-access-request-form-prefilled.md], a prefilled version of the original [Uber-subject-access-request-form.pdf], by replacing the templating entries. Pay attention to (*) symbols, so for the `country of residence` entry, leave empty and let Uber determine which law applies (they might make a mistake!). 
- preferably from the address used to register for Uber, send that filled form as attachment to Pein Van Noort ( pein.vannoort@uber.com ) with subject "Subject access request" and text "Please find attached a Subject Access Request form"
- preferably from the address used to register for Uber, send [letter.md] to Pein Van Noort ( pein.vannoort@uber.com ) and Cc: GetMy@PersonalData.IO (after changing {{requester.name}} in the template)
