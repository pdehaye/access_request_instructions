Is there a specific type of data you are looking for? Choose:

1. My Ratings
2. My Comments
3. My Trips
4. Other...

Response:

1. yes
2. yes
3. yes

If your reply to the question above was "4. Other", please specify:

It is not the data subject's responsibility to list the type of data they are looking for. The data controller is supposed to disclose all the data if that is what the data subject wants. Indeed, I want full access to my personal data, so my request covers all of 1., 2., 3. and 4. For clarification purposes, 4. includes the following information: 
 - any IP, wifi, positional, gyroscopic or accelerometer information collected by Uber through my device at any time (including, but not exclusively, the accuracy of those measurements and any timestamps); 
 - any IP, wifi, positional, gyroscopic or accelerometer information collected by Uber through any device located in a car at the time of my travel with said car (including, but not exclusively, the accuracy of those measurements and any timestamps); 
 - any information about battery life, charge, rate of charge etc of my device that might have been collected at any time; 
 - the number of Uber riders who were offered (resp. declined) to give me a ride, aggregated per ride request; 
 - etc
Again, this list is by no means exhaustive as it is actually Uber's responsibility to make it so.
