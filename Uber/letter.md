Dear Pein Van Noort (Uber Legal Director Privacy, EMEA), 

This is a request for access to my personal data held by Uber, as well as a request for notice regarding Uber's practices.

I have duly completed Uber's Subject Access Request form, which you will receive in a separate email. I remind you that Uber has limited time to comply with this request, and ask that no part of the request should delay any other in case some of the data I am requesting is difficult to access. Should Uber refuse or delay a response to parts of my request on grounds that some of my request needs additional resources, I remind you of Uber's obligation to then provide some cost and time estimates for responding to the request fully.

I additionally ask that Uber gives full notice of its practices around my personal data, with a view of truly obtaining specific and informed consent. By way of example, I ask that you expand exhaustively on any use of words in your Privacy Policy that do not provide a full and clear picture of your data practices, such as for instance the words "for instance", "for example", "etc", "e.g.". 

Throughout the processing of this request, I wish to be assisted by the web service PersonalData.IO. For this reason I ask you to Cc: GetMy@PersonalData.IO for any communication concerning the processing of my request. However I also ask you not to communicate to that service any more information that is strictly necessary for its purpose of providing assistance. For instance, I ask you not to send that email address any of the personal data I am requesting when you get around completing my access request. 
As a first step in this protracted process, I ask you to confirm by responding to this email (and thus Cc'ing GetMy@PersonalData.IO ) that you have received my separate email including the filled Subject Access Request form (but not to send that form to GetMy@PersonalData.IO, since it contains additional personal information unnecessary to determine the scope of my request, such as my phone number). 

Sincerely yours,

{{requester.name}}
